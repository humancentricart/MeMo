# MeMo


Welcome to the **MeMo Lab**. This is the repository where we can all experiment with this new paradigm for building Language Models. 

We are maintaining three different versions:
1) **MeMoCMM.py**: A simple version realized within PyTorch only using vector-matrix operations 
2) **MeMoPyTorch**: A version that exploits the Neural Network modules in order to be ready for the *learning phase* after the *memorization*
3) **MeMoHF**: The HuggingFace version that sees MeMo as a transformer architecture so that it can be exploited in existing solutions

This package contains:
- a **PlayingWithMeMo** for the three versions that show how to memorize, how to retrieve and how to forget
- The **Experiments** proposed in the paper

Enjoy and **MeMo**rize!
