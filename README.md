# MeMo

This software will be soon released as a public repository

We are mantaining three different versions:
1) **MeMoCMM.py**: A simple version realized within PyTorch only using vector matrix operations 
2) **MeMoPyTorch**: A version that exploit the Neural Network modules in order to be ready for the *learning phase* after the *memorization*
3) **MeMoHF**: The HuggingFace version that see MeMo as a transformer architecture so that it can be exploited in existing solutions

This package contains:
- a **PlayingWithMeMo** for the three versions that show how to memorize, how to retrieve and how to forget
- The **Experiments** proposed in the paper

Enjoy and **MeMo**rize!
